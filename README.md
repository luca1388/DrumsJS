# DrumsJS

## About this project
This project is getting inspired by the course [Javascript30](https://javascript30.com/) where in Vanilla JS is used in this particular example to create a simple Drums kit just by pressing keys on your keyboard. [Here](https://master.d3vjoh6uk6k1x2.amplifyapp.com/) you can see a live preview of this implementation. Don't forget to turn speaker on to hear the sounds!
